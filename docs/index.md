# FEntwumS Project Documenation - _An Open-Source FPGA Development Environment_

This project focuses on the development of an intuitive, open-source development environment for FPGAs. The goal is to create comprehensive design tools with simulation and visualization capabilities for implementing digital circuits. 

These docs should help you get started and contribute to this project.

## Project Structure

FEntwumS can be divided into three subprojects:

- [**FPGA Design Tools**](/design_tools.md): Visualization and simulation features for digital circuit development.
- **Graphical System Builder and Circuit Design Tool**: A graphical design tool for creating custom SoC configurations.
- **AI Accelerator**: Development of tools and accelerators designed for efficient processing of AI algorithms.

This GitHub organization focuses on the first two subprojects.

They are implemented as multiple plugins for [OneWare Studio](https://github.com/one-ware/OneWare), an open-source IDE for FPGA design. Read more about general OneWare (plugin) development in  
[**A Brief Introduction to OneWare Studio and its Plugins**](/oneware.md).
