NetlistViewer \u00b6 The main feature is the NetlistViewer . It is built on top of the open-source tool yosys . Yosys parses the HDL design and outputs the netlist, which is then converted by the FEntwumS Backend into a layout. This layout is used by the Frontend to render a graph view. To make development with OneWare seamless, the FEntwumS Plugins add interactions to OneWare's Waveform Viewer. This way, the Waveform Viewer, Netlist Viewer, and Source Code are connected via mouse clicks, making it easy to jump from one view to another while debugging.","title":"Design Tools"},{"location":"design_tools/#design-tools","text":"The design tools offer an easy-to-use design flow to implement and debug digital circuits in OneWare.","title":"Design Tools"},{"location":"design_tools/#netlistviewer","text":"The main feature is the NetlistViewer .

It uses the Avalonia frontend framework. To start developing a plugin for OneWare, use the template, OneWare provides and follow the steps here: https://one-ware.com/docs/studio/plugins/write-plugin/. It is advised to use Intellij Rider to develop the .NET OneWare Plugins. It packs a comprehensive building/running and debugging workflow for .NETs module management. Prism \u00b6 OneWare currently uses Prism to enable loosely coupled development. This also enables plugin development for OneWare. The plugin registers itself in the container registry, when being loaded in OneWare. NuGet \u00b6 NuGet is a package manager for the Microsoft development platform, primarily used for managing .NET libraries and dependencies. It the process of incorporating third-party libraries into .NET projects by providing a central repository of reusable code packages. OneWare uses NuGet to provide its API via shared packages. This way your OneWare plugin development can always use the newest API OneWare provides for the interaction with your plugin. NuGet package management can also be done from Rider. If your plugin is dependend on another plugins NuGet packages, a local NuGet repositories often make sense. Since publishing NuGet repositories in the development of your plugin is often not desired. A local NuGet Feed can be created,then fetched from your .NET project.

The exact specification may be found in the ELK documentation . The following options are used in the generation of the document: omitZeroDimension \u2192 Whenever no dimension is specified for a given element, the receiving program should assume that it is 0 instead omitZeroPosition \u2192 Whenever no position is specified for a given element, the receiving program should assume that it is 0 instead shortLayoutOptionKeys \u2192 All layout options are shortened to reduce file size The document contains some, if not all the options described here in addition to the layout options included in ELK. Hash generation \u00b6 To uniquely identify the netlists on the backend server, the client must send an identifying hash alongside them. This hash is generated using the one_at_a_time hash function by Bob Jenkins. The hash is a 64 bit unsigned integer, where the upper 32 bits are the hashed absolute path of the netlist file, while the lower 32 bits are the hashed contents of the netlist file. Creating a graph representation of a given netlist \u00b6 /graphLocalFile \u00b6 Parameters: filename : The absolute path pointing to the netlist file hash : The hash that is to be usd for this file. This hash is generated as described here Notes: - This call only works when the file is located on the same system as the running backend executable. /graphRemoteFile \u00b6 Parameters: file : A multipart file, containing the netlist files' contents hash : The hash that is to be usd for this file. This hash is generated as described here Modifying or retreiving an existing graph \u00b6 The following calls only return results if the referenced netlist already exists on the backend server. /expandNode \u00b6 This call collapses the given cell, if it is expanded (its' children are visible) or vice-versa. Parameters: hash : The hash that is to be usd for this file. This hash is generated as described here nodepath : The path of the node that is to be collapsed or expanded. Can be found in the location-path option Notes: While cells have their location-path set, they can neither be expanded or collapsed, as they have no children This call forces a partial re-layout of the graph.
